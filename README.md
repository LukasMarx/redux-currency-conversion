You will probably agree with me, that angular applications can become quite hard to overlook as they become bigger. Information is passed from parent-components to child-components, @Output goes into @Input, and at the end of the day, nobody knows where the malformed result comes from.

Simply put, Redux is a principle of organizing your applications code structure, to keep the state of your application at a central place. 

In this tutorial, you will not only learn the details of the Redux architecture, you will also learn, how to implement Redux into your own angular applications.
